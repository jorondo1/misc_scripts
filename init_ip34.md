# Log onto ip34
Using your shell, log onto ip34:

	ssh your_digital_alliance_username@ip34.ccs.usherbrooke.ca

	newgrp def-ilafores
Otherwise, any file you create will only be readable and writable by you.

# Initial setup

	echo umask 007 >> ~/.bashrc # Allow others within your group to write/execute your files

	echo module use $MUGQIC_INSTALL_HOME/modulefiles  >> ~/.bashrc
